      Although CSS is a different language than HTML, it's
      possible to write CSS code directly within an HTML
      file. This is possible because of the <style> element.

      The <style> element allows you to write CSS code between
      its opening and closing tags. To use the <style> element,
      it must be placed inside of the head.
