09 - Box Borders Notes

You can use the following properties:

border-top-width
border-right-width
border-bottom-width
border-left-width

Each property affects the width of only one side of the border,
giving you more flexibility in customization.

The color of a border can also be customized with the border-color property.

div.container {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 3px;
  border-color: rgb(22, 77, 100);
}

The border-color property accepts colors in the various formats you learned about earlier: named colors,
RGB(a) colors, and hex colors. It's common to use hex colors for borders,
but you'll likely also come across RGB(a) colors as well.

The code in the example above can be shortened using the border property:

div.container {
  border: 3px solid rgb(22, 77, 100);
}

It's considered best practice to follow the width-style-color order when using the border property.

The corners of an element's border box can be modified with the border-radius property.
You can create a border that is a perfect circle by setting the radius equal to the
height of the box, or to 100%

div.container {
  border: 3px solid rgb(22, 77, 100);
  border-radius: 5px;
}
