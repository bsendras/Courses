Understanding the Box Model:

1- All HTML elements are contained within a box.
2- Boxes have two dimensions: a width and a height. These dimensions can be modified with the width and height properties.
3- Width and height dimensions can be set using one of three units of measurement: pixels, ems, or percentages.
4- A minimum and maximum width or height can be set for a box. This helps ensure that content remains legible when a user shrinks or expands their browser window.
5- If an element's box becomes too small, the content may overflow. The overflowed content can be controlled with the overflow property.
