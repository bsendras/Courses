Adding Images

we can modify the dimensions of an image using the width and height properties.

<img src="#" alt="" class="" />

img.X {
  width: 350px;
  height: 200px; 
}

It's important to specify the width and height for an image on your web page, as
this helps the browser know exactly how much space should be reserved for the image,
rather than having to download an entire image for the user.
Ideally, however, images should be saved at the dimensions that they will be displayed.
For example, rather than specify a height and a width for an image using CSS, that....

Centering

Images can also be centered, but first, their default behavior must be changed. By default,
images are inline elements. For images to center properly, they must behave as block-level elements.

img.leaf {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px; 
  display: block;
  margin: 0px auto;
}

In the example above, the image is aligned using the margin property. The top and bottom margins of
the image's box are set to 0 margin. The left and right margins are set to auto, which automatically
sets the exact amount of margin needed on the left and right sides in order to center the image.

Note: To align images to the left or right side of a page, you can use the float property you learned
about earlier.

mages can also be added to the backgrounds of HTML elements with the background-image property.

body {
  background-image: url("https://www.example.com/leaf.jpg");
}

REPEAT

You can control how a background image repeats with the background-repeat property. This property
can take one of four values:

repeat - the default value â€” the image will repeat horizontally and vertically.
repeat-x - the background image will be repeated only along the x-axis (horizontally).
repeat-y - the background image will be repeated only along the y-axis (vertically).
no-repeat - the background image will not be repeated at all and will appear only once.

p {
  background-image: url("#");
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
}

POSITION

When a background image is not repeated, its position can be modified with the background-position
property.

p {
  background-image: url("#");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right center;
}

A background image is positioned using a 3 by 3 grid (three rows, three columns), meaning there are
9 total possible positions for the image:

left top - top left corner of the element's box.
center top - top center of the element's box.
right top - top right corner of the element's box.
left center - left column, center row.
center center - the center of the element's box.
right center - right column, center row.
left bottom - bottom left corner of the element's box.
center bottom - bottom center of the element's box.
right bottom - bottom right corner of the element's box.

Note that the values are in pairs.

Note: When setting this property, if only one value is specified, the second value will default to
center.

shorthand for set the image, repetition pattern and position:

background property.

p {
  background: url("#") no-repeat right center;
}

NOTE:It's considered best practice to follow this order of values when setting the background property.

BACKGROUND SIZE

To modify a background image's size, you can use the background-size property.

Values:

cover - expands the image as large as possible to cover the full width or height of a container.
If the dimensions of the container (say, a div) are larger than the dimensions of the image, the
image will become distorted. This value is best for images that don't communicate important content 
o the user, like background images.

contain - expands the image as large as possible, but the image will be letterboxed, which means it
won't cover the full width or height of a container.

div.header {
  height: 400px;
  width: 100%;
  background: url("#") no-repeat right center;
  background-size: cover;
}

IMPORTANTE - Background fixed!!

With the background-attachment property, you can specify whether or not a background image should
remain at one position on the web page or whether it should move up and down as the user scrolls
through a web page.

The background-attachment property can take one of two values:

scroll - this value allows the image to move up and down as a user scrolls on the web page (this is
the default value).

fixed - this value pins the image's position on the page.

p {
  background: url("#") no-repeat right center;
  background-attachment: fixed;
}

In the example above, the background image will remained fixed as a user scrolls through the web page.

GRADIENT

A wide variety of different background styles are used across many modern websites today. Some sites
use large images in their layout, while others use creative color gradients as their background.

The background-image property you learned about earlier allows you to do more than simply set the
background image of an element. It also lets you use color gradients in your web page.

Gradients are planned to be a part of the newest revision of CSS, CSS3. Due to the many browsers
available, there is no standard way of defining a gradient using CSS (different browsers require
different syntax). In this exercise, we'll look at one value supported on a couple of major browsers.

The background-image property can be set to the following value:

-webkit-linear-gradient() - this value accepts two arguments: the two colors the linear gradient will
transition to and from. The colors are usually specified as hex color codes.

div.header {
  height: 400px;
  width: 400px;
  background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(#666CCC, #BC1324);
}

In a later course, you'll learn more about the -webkit-linear-gradient syntax, as well as other similar
CSS values. For now, it's important to understand how to create a linear gradient using the value in the
example above.


Smmary:

You've learned how to add images to a web page using the <img> element and the background property.
What's the difference between these two methods? When should one method be used over another?

The method used depends on the type of image.

Some images are part of the content of a web page (icons, logos, album photos, etc.) and they communicate
important information to a user. Other images are intended simply to style a web page (header backgrounds, 
tc.), not to communicate important information.

When an image communicates important information, you can use the <img> element and style the image using
CSS, if needed.

When an image is intended to style a web page, you can use the background property and further style it
with CSS.
