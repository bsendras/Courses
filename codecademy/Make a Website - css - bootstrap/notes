BOOTSTRAP

One of the reasons Bootstrap and frameworks like it are so popular is because
they offer grids. A grid makes it possible to organize HTML elements using
preconfigured columns. Using a grid, you can customize responsive page layouts
quickly and reliably.

The Bootstrap grid contains 12 equal-sized columns, as seen in the diagram on
the right. HTML elements are arranged to span different numbers of columns in
order to create custom page layouts.

In the diagram(bootstrap-grid.png), observe the following:

Bootstrap's grid columns are represented by 12 vertical bars. The boxes represent HTML elements.

The words "container", "jumbotron", "col-sm-6" and "col-sm-3" refer to Bootstrap classes. 

The element with class "jumbotron" spans the entire width of the webpage, beyond the borders of the grid. 

Elements inside the second "container", such as "col-sm-6" and "col-sm-3" are contained within the grid columns. 

Elements labeled "col-sm-3" take up three grid columns; elements labeled "col-sm-6" take up six grid columns.

EXAMPLE

NAV

Let's use Bootstrap's grid to create a simple header with navbar.

In the example code below, an HTML header element with Bootstrap's predefined container class is used:

<header class="container">
  ...
</header>

Inside the header, a row is created by using a div with Bootstrap's row class:

<header class="container">
  <div class="row">
  </div> 
</header>

Finally, the row is cut into two parts:

<header class="container">
  <div class="row">
   <h1 class="col-sm-4">Heading</h1>
   <nav class="col-sm-8 text-right">
    <p>nav item 1</p>
    <p>nav item 2</p>
    <p>nav item 3</p>
   </nav> 
 </div>
</header>

The first part consists of the h1 with Bootstrap's class col-sm-4. It will take up the first four columns on
the grid. The second part consists of the nav element with class col-sm-8. It will take up the remaining eight
grid columns. text-right indicates that text will be arranged on the right side of the nav.

JUMBOTRON

In addition to a header/navigation, many websites have a large showcase area featuring important content.
Bootstrap refers to this as a jumbotron. Below is an example implementation of a jumbotron.

First, a new section element is created and assigned the jumbotron class:

<section class="jumbotron">

</section>

Next a div with the Bootstrap class container is used:

<section class="jumbotron">
  <div class="container">
  ... 
  </div>
</section>

A div with the Bootstrap class row text-center can center subsequent child elements which will contain text:

<section class="jumbotron">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row text-center">
       ...
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

The ... is a placeholder for HTML elements containing text, such as h2, p or anchor elements.

SUPPORTING CONTENT

Many websites have a supporting content area. Supporting content can be arranged using Bootstrap's
grid. Below is an example implementation of a supporting content area.

First, an HTML section element with the container class is used:

<section class="container">

</section>

Next, div elements with the row class are added:

<section class="container">
  <div class="row">
  </div>
  <div class="row">
  </div>
</section>

Finally, the rows are divided by using divs with Bootstrap's col-sm-... class.

<section class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
     ...
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
     ...
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
     ...
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
     ...
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

Above, two rows are divided into two equal parts. Each part takes up 6 of bootstrap's 12 columns.
Using the col-sm-6 class ensures that this layout will appear when the user's screen is the width
of a tablet device(768 pixels). On narrower screens, such as an iPhone, only one image per row will appear.

FOOTER

Footers display copyright information, social media links and sometimes site navigation.

Below is one possible implementation for a footer section using Bootstrap:

First, a footer element with Bootstrap's container class is used:

<footer class="container">

</footer>

Inside the footer, a div with Bootstrap's row class is added to hold footer content:

<footer class="container">
  <div class="row">
  ... 
  </div>
</footer>

Finally, the row is divided into parts using Bootstrap's grid. Here is one suggestion:

<footer class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <p class="col-sm-4">...</p>
    <ul class="col-sm-8">
      <li class="col-sm-1">...</li>
      <li class="col-sm-1">...</li>
      <li class="col-sm-1">...</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</footer>

Above, the row is broken into three parts: a p element that takes up four columns, a ul which
takes up 8 columns, and li items which take up 1 column each. The lis could hold navigation menu
items or social media icons.

Again, because the col-sm-... class is used, this layout will appear on tablet-width screens and
wider. Screen sizes smaller than tablet-width (768 pixels), will not maintain this layout.
